It supports both .dol and .elf files and compressing them for a faster transfer rate.  You can optionally send arguments to the application when it runs.  WiiTCPLoad was originally created by Strikeu, along with modifications for OS X from Tinman, at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wiitcpload/.  This version has been updated to support the latest Homebrew Channel.\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n=========\r\n[Windows](http://fostermclane.tk/wiitcpload/wiitcpload-win32.exe)\r\n\r\nMac OS X - Someone with Mac OS X needs to build this\r\n\r\n[Linux 32-bit](http://fostermclane.tk/wiitcpload/wiitcpload-linux-x86)\r\n\r\n[Linux 64-bit](http://fostermclane.tk/wiitcpload/wiitcpload-linux-x86_64)\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n==========\r\n![](http://wiibrew.org/w/images/2/2a/Wiitcploadgui.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
